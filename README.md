## My Interests

I have a deep love for consoles and am fascinated by the inner workings of systems. I enjoy exploring ways to modify and optimize them, often diving into the world of jailbreaking. I believe that users should have the freedom to fully utilize their devices without being restricted by high costs or locked-down systems. That said, my activities are strictly for educational purposesâ€”I'm all about learning and pushing the boundaries of technology, not piracy.
